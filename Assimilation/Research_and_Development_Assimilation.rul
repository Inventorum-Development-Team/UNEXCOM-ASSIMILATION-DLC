      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_1_UFOPEDIA: "Since July 10, 1947, we know that there is alien life. The famous Roswell case, which was said to be a meteorological balloon, was actually a Small Scout who collided during what we believe was a reconnaissance mission. The United States government quickly secured the remains and began its investigation. These data collected, despite having more than 25 years, are useful in these moments of terror."
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_2: "UNEXCOM Report 2"
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_2_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The number of UFO sightings around the world has increased, ranging from strange lights around military and civilian aircraft, strange spots on the radar that appear and disappear, to abductions, livestock theft and unprecedented climate change. It seems that our belligerence attracts them, given that there are military reports of lights in the skies of the battlefield and near military bases."
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_3: "UNEXCOM Report 3"
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_3_UFOPEDIA: "In the last decade, contacts with extraterrestrial entities have begun to be more violent. On April 25, 1968, a Lufthansa commercial aircraft was shot down in mysterious conditions after disappearing from the radar, near the Alps. Authorities attributed it to a fissure in the fuselage, although military observers noticed a strange flash before the accident.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} A similar case, but this time on American soil, occurs on October 5, 1971. A commercial TWA flight is intercepted over Massachusetts. Units of the Tactical Air Command are scrambled to engage the hostiles and an air combat takes place between four F-4 Phantom II and the UFO. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Boeing 747 and three Phantom were shot down. The UFO, despite being severely damaged, was able to escape. However, this aerial battle served to understand better the enemy that awaits us. Our surveillance systems could briefly analyze their characteristics."

      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_4_UFOPEDIA: "Motivated by these acts of war, on March 18, 1972 a session of the UN Security Council is called in New York. At this meeting, representatives of the world powers agreed to form a more aggressive initiative to contain the growing unknown threat. The project is called the United Nations Extraterrestrial Combat Command and should take action by autumn of the same year. Enough time to gather all the equipment, planes, weapons and necessary personnel, both civil and military, to be able to face any threat to the Earth."
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_5: "UNEXCOM Report 5"
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_5_UFOPEDIA: "UNEXCOM has the best scientists, engineers, specialists and soldiers from different armed forces from all around the world, including army, navy and air force. We count on the support of various space agencies, such as NASA, the European Space Research Organisation and Soviet space agencies to support UNEXCOM in the astronautics and scientific fields that may be required. We have absolute clearance to overfly any country and to deploy combat missions without any restrictions, sometimes even with local support. Our motto is 'AD HONOREM. AD PERPETUA MEMORIA.

All these use the distinctive blue color of the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces, but in a darker tone, to symbolize that their mission is not exclusive to maintaining peace, but to defend the planet and humanity."
      STR_UNEXCOM_PILOTS: "Our Pilots"
      STR_UNEXCOM_PILOTS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our pilots are the Crème de la crème of the world's air forces. Experienced fighters from all over the world volunteered for the Project. Most have fought in Vietnam, Korea and there are even veterans of World War II. They were selected for the almost suicidal mission to protect the skies of Earth. Maybe we do not have the technology of the alien pilots and crafts, but we compensate with skill, dexterity and bravery. All airplanes need pilots, it is recommended to choose the most aggressive for fighters and bombers."
      STR_AIR_COMBAT: "Air Combat"
      STR_AIR_COMBAT_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}One of our most important weapons to defend the planet is military aviation. In 1961, on what is known today as 'Nordiska Kraschen',The Nordic Crash, a single unidentified flying object (which we now believe was a Medium Scout) was spotted throughout northern Europe, flying at incredible speed. A pair of SAAB J29F Tunnan were scrambled to engage the object and after a dogfight, was shot down. This, along with the Massachusetts event, showed that UFOs aren't invincible. The United Nations equipped us with surplus Tunnan fighters provided by the Swedish Air Force. Old, but reliable."

      STR_SHOTGUN_REPORT: "Shotgun Report"
      STR_SHOTGUN_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Shotguns are powerful weapons and like SMGs, are meant to be used on close combat. Buckshots are great for crowd control and slugs are best for mid-range combat.

      STR_MEDICAL_ITEMS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Healing and recovering tools and medicine, meant to patch up wounds, recover stamina and health. Having a healthy soldier means another weapon firing on the enemies, don't forget to carry enough on the battlefield."

      STR_WEAPON_MODIFICATION_UFOPEDIA: "Our gunsmiths and engineers are very skilled and are able to design and modify certain weapons to create customized variants of those. To customise a weapon, we need the weapon itself and an another part (like scopes, grenade launchers, et cetera). We can get further blueprints with the help of experts, like Special Forces operators and even Mercenaries. However, asking for the help of one faction will permanently disable the other one, choose carefully."

      STR_MERCENARY_SUPPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Through non-official means, we have managed to contact soldiers who are members of a private military company, who have agreed to provide us with their services as military advisors, even participating in combat, if necessary.

While this may pose an initial difficulty, we feel it is the option that would least affect the delicate geopolitical balance by not favoring any one faction. Instead, we have the support of the rest of the UN to equip our troops. This does not mean that we are antagonizing anyone, as we will still work side by side with all UN member countries.

At the end of our meeting, we were given an SG 510-4 Carbine, informing us that this exclusive weapon could be given to our soldiers. We have been warned that European politicians and military do not like cooperation with the Soviets, so it is a fact that they will withdraw their support if we engage in official talks with the USSR. The Americans have also expressed that they'll only support us if we ask exclusively them, so they will turn away if we seek european support. "

We cannot reveal their names, but they have offered to assist us in soliciting support from the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union in general, if we so wish.  As a sign of good faith, they have given us an AKMSU carbine, for the exclusive use of the VDV airborne forces, a rare piece to find. However, we have been informed that Soviet politicians will not tolerate a rapprochement with NATO or the United States, so perhaps we should be careful not to lose possible open Soviet help."

      STR_ALLOY_CRAFT_ARMOR_UC: ALLOY CRAFT ARMOR
      STR_ALLOY_CRAFT_ARMOR: Alloy Craft Armor
      STR_ALLOY_CRAFT_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: Armor plates made of Alien Alloys, designed to be installed in  UNEXCOM aircrafts to increase durability. Damage Max +100

      STR_IMPROVED_LIGHT_MISSILE: "Improved Light Missile"
      STR_IMPROVED_LIGHT_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Recent advances in materials science have allowed us, in collaboration with the Raytheon company, to create a new model of lightweight missile, equipped with a modern chassis built entirely with Alien Alloys. Because it is lighter, it can carry more of a heavier warhead. In addition, avionics systems designed by our engineers, based on air combat so far, have allowed to improve the built-in heat tracker."
      STR_IMPROVED_HEAVY_MISSILE: "Improved Heavy Missile"
      STR_IMPROVED_HEAVY_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Using our knowledge gained from using heavy radar-guided missiles against UFOs, we have been able to isolate the waves they reflect to some extent. This new active radar is considerably larger and more advanced. It is still in prototype stages, but the new R-72 Scimitar missile, built with the help of NPO Vympel, includes the new Alien Alloys frames and all the explosives that could fit inside the missile."
      STR_IMPROVED_GATLING_CANNON: "Improved Gatling Cannon"
      STR_IMPROVED_GATLING_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "General Electric engineers have been very enthusiastic about improving their famous Gatling M61 Vulcan cannon. They have visited our laboratory and engineering bay to support us in creating a new gun based on the Vulcan. By using the famous Alien Alloys, we have designed a more efficient weapon that resists the intense heat of the weapon much better. We are satisfied with the result. Improved Revolver research is required to produce the ammunition."
      STR_IMPROVED_REVOLVER_CANNON: Improved Revolver Cannon
      STR_IMPROVED_REVOLVER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Our gunsmiths had the idea to use the BK-27 gun created by Mauser to improve it with the new Alien Alloys. The result could not have been better, and even the designers in West Germany congratulated our team of engineers. Being lighter, we were able to put in a new firing mechanism and a considerably stronger barrel. After firing 10,000 rounds, the barrel barely warmed up at all. The extra firepower will benefit our pilots. Improved Gatling research is required to produce the ammunition."
      STR_IMPROVED_SUPER_HEAVY_MISSILE: "Improved Super Heavy Missile"
      STR_IMPROVED_SUPER_HEAVY_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Nuclear weapons remain a difficult subject to deal with, even though this war is being waged against non-human enemies. We have obtained authorization from the UNSC to upgrade our Falcon missiles using the new technology being researched. They have allowed us to design a new fuselage and avionics system (which translates into more range and accuracy), but we still have to keep the same W54 warhead, so the damage inflicted will remain the same. To produce it, we must use an existing Falcon and modify it completely."
      STR_IMPROVED_ROCKET: "Improved Rocket"
      STR_IMPROVED_ROCKET_UFOPEDIA: "This project is incredibly cheap, since we are using a cost-efficient platform as a base. The unguided Mk 4 Hydra 70 rocket, used by the USAF since the Korean War to provide close support, has been adapted with new Alien Alloy materials and an improved penetration head, made of tungsten. Laboratory tests have proven its reliability. The Soviets are said to be very interested in this weapon to equip the Hind they have provided us with, a further sign that the rivalries between the USA and the USSR are diminishing... at least a little."

      STR_ADVANCED_BOMBER: "Advanced Bomber"
      STR_ADVANCED_BOMBER_UFOPEDIA: "Tactical bomber project implementing hybrid and stealth technology For this project we have moved away from classic aircraft construction and have taken a more 'organic' design.  In tests it has proven to be considerably invisible to the radar used by our aircraft, and we hope that this same feature will be used in aerial combat against UFOs."
      STR_ADVANCED_FIGHTER: "Advanced Fighter"
      STR_ADVANCED_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a novel project. Grumman has created a new heavy naval fighter designed to protect American fleets and our diplomatic liaisons have managed to contact this company to design an aircraft entirely built by UNEXCOM. Using the F-14 Tomcat as a base, we have added for the first time stealth technology based on a modified version of the Alien Alloys, retaining the large weapon carrying capacity and sweep wings. "

      STR_AIR_STRIKES: "Close Air Support"
      STR_AIR_STRIKES_UFOPEDIA: "The Council has provided us access to close air support from airbases located in council nations near the area of operations. Though expensive, they can grant a tactical advantage if used correctly. UNEXCOM operatives can call in close air support by priming and throwing a signal smoke grenade. The air support will take a few turns to arrive, it is advised this time is used to make sure no friendly combatants are in the blast zone. Signal smoke grenades should not be used indoors, as this prevents the close air support from finding the target, meaning the attack run will not be completed"

      STR_OUTSOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the growing size of our airwing, our engineering department cannot keep up with the demand of manufacturing ammunition for the advanced weapons systems developed by our research department. Therefore the council has approved our request to move production of certain weapon system munitions into factories maintained by council members. While this arrangement will free up our resources to focus on other things, giving individual council nations access to powerful new weapons might have repercussions once this conflict is over"

      STR_OLYMPUS: "Project Olympus"
      STR_OLYMPUS_UFOPEDIA: "It is clear that the only way to end this invasion is to attack the enemy directly at their door. We cannot win a war of attrition on Earth, it only costs us more men and cities. The Security Council determined to reactivate Project Olympus, focused on creating an interplanetary strike force. The blueprints and partially build ships were stored in a secure vault for 10 years until the worst event happened and our planet became besieged by alien forces. It will take us a while to get everything ready, in the meantime we must buy as much time as possible."
      STR_OLYMPUS_ORION: "Project Olympus - Orion"
      STR_OLYMPUS_ORION_UFOPEDIA: "The design was created in the early 60s by NASA as an effective mean to get to Mars and beyond using the existing technology. But the fears of an alien invasion motivated president Kennedy and Premier Kruschev to propose an armed version. Our most reliable and effective way to use nuclear weapons is to adapt them into shaped charges (similar of those used by Casaba Howitzers) to propel the pusher plate behind the ship. Their armament is composed of naval batteries, ballistic missile racks and 20mm CWIS cannons plus Hangar storage for 6 smaller vehicles."
      STR_OLYMPUS_SHUTTLE: "Project Olympus - Shuttle"
      STR_OLYMPUS_SHUTTLE_UFOPEDIA: "This project has its origins in the late 1960s, when several concepts were explored by NASA for a reusable space vehicle to replace the Apollo capsules. A space plane, which would take off vertically and land on a runway. Due to the invasion, we have applied new materials, as well as additional shielding and engines for VTOL maneuvers. The X-73 Raider is the only aircraft in our arsenal that can transport troops into space."
      STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION: "Operation Devastation"
      STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Our Recon probes found the characteristic gravitational signals emitted by UFOs in the surface of the Moon. More specifically, Tycho Crater. Pyramid-like structures with what seems AA batteries and turrets has been spotted. Our task force is getting ready for deployment using the new space shuttles. NASA Command will help with us recon and logistics support and the Soviet forces will land alongside us. "
      STR_DESTINATION_MARS: "Destination Mars"
      STR_DESTINATION_MARS_UFOPEDIA: "The Viking probes sent to Mars have found the location of the suspected alien base on a region identified as Cydonia. The most shocking news are the clear evidence of a city-like complex and what appears to be a humanoid face. The information has been shared to the UN General Assembly and the Security Council has approved the creation of the United Nations Space Command to coordinate the joint efforts of the American, Soviet and European aerospace forces. The Orion Nuclear Battleships are almost ready to go. We need to hold the invaders on the ground as much as we can to gain more time for the invasion fleet."
      STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST: "Operation Downfall"
      STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST_UFOPEDIA: "We have completed the construction of the three Orion Nuclear Battleships. Each World Power has christened each one and provided crew and landing troops, with vehicle complement of Sabre Exoatmospheric Fighters and Raider Shuttles. The Ares Expeditionary Force will be composed of UNS Enterprise, UNS Marathon and UNS Stalingrad and will be take us three weeks to get to Mars orbit. The time has come. Operation Downfall will begin as soon as we are ready to take off."

      STR_EXOATMOSPHERIC_FIGHTERS_UFOPEDIA: "To take the fight back to the aliens, we need to be able to fight them outside of our atmosphere. To do this a new generation of fighter craft has been created. Capable of fighting with equal ability both outside and inside our atmosphere, these craft can also reach immense speeds by exiting the atmosphere and therefore avoiding air resistance altogether."
